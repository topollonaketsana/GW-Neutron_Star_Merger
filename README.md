# Overview

This project investigates binary neutron star systems with the aim of understanding:

The behavior of extremely dense matter under strong gravity,

How such systems evolve and emit gravitational waves,

The connection between compact object mergers and observable astrophysical signals.

By modeling orbital dynamics and applying theoretical physics, we aim to build a foundation for simulating gravitational waveforms from these extreme environments.
